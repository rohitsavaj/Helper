# Lazy load iframes on scroll, throttled
 _A Pen created at CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/cjl750/pen/pEAmgR](https://codepen.io/cjl750/pen/pEAmgR).

 This Pen checks whether an iframe is partly visible within the viewport and, if so, changes its data-source to its source. It uses Underscore.js to throttle the scrolling function.
